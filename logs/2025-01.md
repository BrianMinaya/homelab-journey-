Progress Logs
1/5/2025

    Updated BIOS.
    Installed drives into caddy bays.
    Configured the HDDs into a RAID 5 virtual disk for redundancy and performance.
    Set up the SSDs as RAID 0 for now (I’ll need to pick up another SSD of each type to add redundancy eventually).
    Installed Proxmox as my type 1 hypervisor:
        I was originally leaning toward VMware, but after some digging, Proxmox came out on top. It’s highly recommended right now and has great container support, which fits what I’m trying to do.

1/6/2025

    Created my first Ubuntu Server VM:
        Specs: 2 cores, 4GB RAM, 32GB Storage.
        Assigned a static IP since Proxmox uses a Linux network bridge to integrate with my home network.
    Installed and set up the basics:
        OpenSSH and PuTTY for easy terminal access (so I can copy/paste commands without a hassle).
        Docker and Portainer to start containerizing workloads.
    Spun up a test NGINX container—everything worked perfectly on the first try.
    Rack mounting hit a snag:
        The first rack rails I got were defective. The right rail fell apart while I was trying to prep it. New rails are on the way and should arrive tomorrow. Fingers crossed they work!
    Realized I need to invest in a UPS system. The server is plugged into a power surge protector for now, but a sudden power outage could be a nightmare with everything running.

1/7/2025

    Installed Windows Server 2022 on a VM:
        Had a few BIOS-related hiccups but got it all sorted in the end.
    More rack rail issues:
        The second set I ordered this week didn’t fit either. I’m done with that seller—getting my money back.
        Ordered some universal rails instead. They should arrive Friday (1/10/2025). Hopefully, these will finally do the job.

1/8/2025

    Installed Veeam Backup & Replication on the Windows Server VM to start setting up proper backups.
    Got hands-on with the Proxmox shell:
        Created a directory and EXT4 partition for the RAID 5 drives.
        Mounted the disk and edited /etc/fstab to make it persistent after reboot.
    Configured NFS on Proxmox:
        Added the mount point to the exports file.
        Mounted the NFS share in Windows using PowerShell.
    Set up a backup repository on the NFS drive:
        Created a backup job that directly targets my Proxmox host (using a new feature in Veeam).
        Veeam spun up a dedicated worker process on my Proxmox host for managing the VM backups.

What’s Next?

I’m waiting on the universal rack rails to finally mount the server properly. After that, I’ll be diving deeper into container orchestration and setting up more automation for backups and monitoring. Still need to find a good UPS system—protection is key when there’s this much hardware involved.
